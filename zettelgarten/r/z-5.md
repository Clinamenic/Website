In section 2.1, Keynes presents two key critiques to the fundamental postulates of the general theory of value and production (see [[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money#Chapter 2, Section I]]).

First, he points out that a decrease in real wages (i.e. decrease in purchasing power), for example due to an increase in prices of goods and services, does not necessarily result in a withdrawal of labor from the market, as might be expected in the course of wage bargaining if there is a decrease in money wages. Second, is that labor collectively and individually not equip to negotiate its real wage below a certain point.
