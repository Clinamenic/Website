In section 11.4, Keynes distinguishes two categories of risk impacting capital investments: borrower's/entrepreneur's risk, and lender's risk. The first is mostly concerned with whether or not the resulting yield will meet expectations, and, if this investment is a loan, whether the yield will cover interest of the loan. The second concerns whether, in the case of an investment using borrowed funds, the investment will yield enough for the loan to be repaid.
