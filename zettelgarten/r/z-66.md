In section 17.1, Keynes highlights how other commodities can be treated as units to measure rate of interest, based on calculations of present value of a commodity, and its value upon some future date of delivery/consumption.

#r/JK/GT/Q/unresolved I personally was not able to comprehend the logic of this section, but I gather the point was to draw attention to why money is a privileged unit of account in terms of establishing rate of interest.
