Reflection 1: So far, without much pre-existing knowledge on the subject, i.e. classical theories of value and production, I gather Keynes is (effectively) demonstrating how the epistemic paradigm of macroeconomics should be fundamentally overhauled to more realistically account for fluctuations in employment. He hasn't gotten deep into interest or money yet, but presumably he will. He frames the classical theory as being overly simplistic and even sanguine ([[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money#Chapter 3, Section III]]) in how it understands mechanisms like the relation between supply and demand, and the negotiations between entrepreneurs and workers regarding wages.
