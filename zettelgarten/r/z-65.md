In section 16.4, Keynes suggests that, if the marginal efficiency of capital is to be diminished while keeping other factors of production at target levels, we may be able to keep employment (and by extension, to some measure, quality of life) at desirable levels. This suggestion seems in keeping with Keynes' attitude against speculators (i.e. non-productive investors and idle accumulators) while still being in favor of reasoned investment based off of assessments of prospective yield, as well as being in favor of entrepreneurial use of capital.
