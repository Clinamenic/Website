Re: [[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money#Chapter 9, Section II]]

In section 9.2, Keynes says that, while these subjective factors do influence the actual propensity to consume, the influence is minor compared to that of the objective factor of income level. He also says that the interest rate exerts a major influence on the actual rate of saving.
