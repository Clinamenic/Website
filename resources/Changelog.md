### Zettelkasten Migration to Luhmann System

**Commit**: `5c42a06` - refactor(zettelgarten): migrate reference notes to Luhmann numbering system

**Major Refactoring**: Complete migration of the zettelgarten reference note system from semantic naming to Luhmann's numerical methodology.

#### Changes Made:

- **Added metadata fields** to all zettel:
  - `zettel-id`: New Luhmann-style identifier
  - `zettel-legacy-id`: Original filename for reference tracking
- **Implemented alphabetic branching** for derivative notes (e.g., `z-26a.md`, `z-27a.md`)
- **Preserved 14 Hub files** unchanged to maintain navigation structure
- **Normalized reference formatting** across 77 files to use consistent YAML list format

  - `scripts/rename_zettel_to_luhmann.py`: Main migration script
