### Search Strategies

#### Keyword Combinations

- "local first" + [domain] (e.g., "local first database")
- "self hosted" + [tool type]
- "decentralized" + [application type]
- "offline first" + [framework/library]
- "p2p" + [specific use case]
- "privacy preserving" + [tool category]

#### Discovery Through Dependencies

- Analyze package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod of known local-first projects
- Follow dependency graphs to discover underlying libraries
- Check "used by" sections on GitHub for adoption indicators

#### Conference & Event Mining

- **DEF CON**: Privacy and security tool showcases
- **CCC (Chaos Communication Congress)**: Decentralization projects
- **FOSDEM**: Open-source project presentations

## Evaluation Framework

### Technical Assessment

- **Architecture**: Truly local-first vs. privacy-washing
- **Data Ownership**: Where is data stored? Who controls it?
- **Network Dependencies**: What happens when offline?
- **Interoperability**: Standards compliance, data portability

### Community Health

- **Development Activity**: Recent commits, issue response times
- **Community Size**: Contributors, users, forum activity
- **Governance**: Open vs. corporate-controlled development
- **Documentation Quality**: Setup guides, API docs, tutorials

### Risk Assessment

- **Bus Factor**: How many key maintainers?
- **Funding Model**: Sustainable development approach?
- **Legal Status**: Licensing, jurisdiction considerations
- **Attack Surface**: Security audit history, vulnerability disclosure

## Organization & Curation Strategy

### Tagging System Enhancement

Expand current tagging to include:

- **Architecture**: `local-first`, `p2p`, `federated`, `self-hosted`
- **Data Control**: `local-storage`, `user-owned-data`, `zero-knowledge`
- **Network**: `offline-capable`, `mesh-network`, `distributed`
- **Trust Model**: `trustless`, `end-to-end-encrypted`, `open-source`
- **Maturity**: `production-ready`, `beta`, `experimental`, `research`

### Quality Scoring

Implement scoring based on:

- Institutional independence (1-5)
- Privacy/security features (1-5)
- Community health (1-5)
- Technical maturity (1-5)
- Documentation quality (1-5)

### Regular Review Process

- Quarterly review of existing entries for link rot, project status
- Annual deep-dive assessment of project health
- Community feedback integration for quality updates

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- Research and document top 50 most critical local-first tools
- Establish evaluation criteria and scoring system
- Set up systematic discovery workflows

### Phase 2: Domain Expansion (Weeks 3-8)

- Deep dive into each category with 20-30 tools per domain
- Focus on discovering lesser-known but high-quality projects
- Build relationships with maintainers and communities

### Phase 3: Community Integration (Weeks 9-12)

- Engage with local-first development communities for recommendations
- Validate findings with domain experts
- Establish ongoing discovery and curation processes

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: 300+ high-quality tools across all categories
