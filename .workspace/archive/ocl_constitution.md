**Contents**

## Context

OpenCivics Labs is a cooperative guild of civic innovators experimenting with emerging approaches in open civic innovation that support collective action responding to critical civilizational challenges.

## Freedom To Participate

You are free to take any action that fulfills the [Purpose](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Network/Labs/constitution_202508141605-draft/1.+Identity/Purpose) of the organization and the [Roles](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Network/Labs/constitution_202508141605-draft/2.+Structure/Roles/Roles+Index) that you hold - as long as you do not violate any [Protocols](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Network/Labs/constitution_202508141605-draft/3.+Protocols/Protocols+Index); and you seek to uphold the  [Values](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Network/Labs/constitution_202508141605-draft/1.+Identity/Values)  and principles of the [Constitution](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Network/Labs/constitution_202508141605-draft/2.+Structure/Assets/Constitution).

## Identity

The core meaning and intentionality of the organism/organization — why it exists, what it serves, and how it stays oriented over time.

### Personal Ethics

_Refers to behavioral and cultural patterns of members._

- Good Faith Collaboration
- Honesty
- Feedback & Accountability
- Efficacy over Ego
- Inclusion & Listening

### System Design Ethics

_Refers to the ethical considerations for the practice of civic innovation._

Three values form a north star that helps us to evaluate the systemic ethics and outcomes of our adaptations. These values represent both a shared collective intent as well as a rubric for peer evaluation of our work towards these shared aims.

- [Vitality](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Concepts/Glossary/vitality)  is the embodied state of  _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.
- [Choice](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Concepts/Glossary/choice)  is the state of fundamental respect for the sovereign  _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.
- [Resilience](https://wiki.opencivics.co/OpenCivics+Concepts/Glossary/resilience)  is the state and the  _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.

| **test**           | If this philosophy were removed or violated, the organization’s identity and integrity would be fundamentally altered — even if its activities remained the same. |

Key pillars of the OpenCivics philosophy include:

**Post-Tragic, Protopian Audacity**  
Rather than collapse into despair or escape into utopia, we embrace the sobriety of collapse with an all-encompassing love. It proposes that we face collapse _not as an end but as a birth_, and build anew through systems of care and a culture of profound empathy.

**Open Civic Systems**  
We challenge the legitimacy of legacy systems by proposing open, composable alternatives. These are “open civic systems” built using open protocols — modular and forkable tools that anyone can adapt to local needs. These systems are animated by a revitalized civic culture and aim to make the old system obsolete by providing a higher quality of life.

**Stigmergy and Swarm Coordination**  
Rather than central command, we embrace stigmergy — a form of decentralized coordination where individual agents signal their actions in such a way that others can contribute in a positive sum feedback loop.

**The Third Attractor**  
We name our desired future not as utopia or collapse, but as a “third attractor” — a horizon of regenerative possibility that outcompetes dominant paradigms by offering greater thriving, meaning, and community. It emphasizes bioregional self-organization, civic imagination, and self-organized open civic systems that promote vitality, participation, and resilience.

**Polycentricity and Mutualism**  
Instead of centralized authority, we support distributed, polycentric governance, where many centers of care and agency overlap. This includes informal solidarity networks, neighborhood councils, and DAOs working together to regenerate local life and global commons.

Labs Projects are semi-autonomous initiatives within the OpenCivics Labs ecosystem. Each project exists as a distinct membrane with its own participants, coordinator(s), and operational protocols. Projects are proposed by members, approved by Managers, and resourced from the Labs Treasury. They are the primary mechanism through which OpenCivics Labs experiments, prototypes, and publishes contributions to the field of open civic innovation.

- All collaborative efforts within the Labs are nested within _projects_
- There’s two types of projects: _internal_ and _external_.
- _Internal_ projects are focused on developing the capacity of the Labs to operate.
- _External_ projects are focused on supporting the capacity of others to operate.
- Labs members propose projects that undergo a _project review process_.
- Approved projects progress in the _project lifecycle_.

Boundaries that regulate participation, permissions, and trust thresholds.

**Membranes** are the foundational structural units within the OpenCivics Labs ecosystem. A membrane is a **semi-permeable boundary** that defines a coherent unit of action, intention, and collaboration. It is composed of a defined set of members, roles, protocols, and assets, and exists to fulfill a particular function in service of the broader mission.

Membranes can take the form of projects, councils, working groups, or any other container that requires internal coherence while remaining open to exchange and coordination with the larger network. They balance autonomy and accountability, enabling focused initiative while staying nested within the larger organism.

Each membrane:

In essence, membranes are the **living cells** of OpenCivics Labs — modular, adaptive, and interdependent. They allow the broader network to scale complexity while maintaining coherence, trust, and purpose-aligned action.
