# Quartz URL Redirect System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for implementing a robust URL redirect system in Quartz to handle content migration and URL changes, specifically addressing the need to redirect from `zettelgarten/` URLs to `writing/` URLs while maintaining SEO value and user experience.

## Current Quartz URL Handling Analysis

### How Quartz Generates URLs

1. **File Path to Slug Conversion** (`quartz/util/path.ts`):
   - `slugifyFilePath()` converts file paths to URL slugs
   - Uses `sluggify()` function for case transformation and character replacement
   - Folder names (except last segment) are converted to lowercase
   - Last segment (filename) preserves original case
   - Special characters are replaced: spaces → `-`, `&` → `-and-`, `%` → `-percent`

2. **Existing Redirect Infrastructure**:
   - `AliasRedirects` plugin already exists for frontmatter-based aliases
   - Generates HTML redirect pages with meta refresh and canonical links
   - Supports `aliases` and `permalink` frontmatter fields
   - Uses `resolveRelative()` for proper relative URL generation

3. **Link Processing**:
   - `CrawlLinks` transformer handles internal link resolution
   - Supports multiple resolution strategies: "relative", "absolute", "shortest"
   - Automatically updates internal links during build

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Redirect Plugin System

#### A. Bulk Redirect Configuration
Create a new plugin `BulkRedirects` that extends the existing redirect functionality:

```typescript
interface BulkRedirectConfig {
  redirects: {
    [sourcePattern: string]: string | RedirectTarget
  }
  preserveQueryParams?: boolean
  preserveHash?: boolean
  redirectType?: 301 | 302 | 307 | 308
  generateCanonicalLinks?: boolean
}

interface RedirectTarget {
  destination: string
  type?: 301 | 302 | 307 | 308
  preserveQuery?: boolean
  preserveHash?: boolean
}
```

#### B. Pattern-Based Redirects
Support glob patterns and regex for flexible URL matching:

```typescript
interface RedirectRule {
  pattern: string // glob or regex pattern
  replacement: string // replacement pattern
  type: 'glob' | 'regex'
  redirectType: 301 | 302 | 307 | 308
}
```

### 2. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Configuration-Based Redirects

1. **Create `BulkRedirects` Plugin**:
   ```typescript
   export const BulkRedirects: QuartzEmitterPlugin<BulkRedirectConfig> = (opts) => ({
     name: "BulkRedirects",
     async emit(ctx, content, resources) {
       // Generate redirect pages for configured patterns
       // Support both exact matches and pattern-based redirects
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Configuration in `quartz.config.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   Plugin.BulkRedirects({
     redirects: {
       // Exact path redirects
       "zettelgarten/Notes on Experimental Zettelkasten Methodology": "writing/Notes on Experimental Zettelkasten Methodology",
       
       // Pattern-based redirects
       "zettelgarten/*": {
         destination: "writing/*",
         type: 301,
         preserveQuery: true,
         preserveHash: true
       }
     }
   })
   ```

#### Phase 2: Migration Detection and Automation

1. **Content Migration Detection**:
   - Scan for files that have moved between directories
   - Generate redirect rules automatically based on file movement
   - Maintain redirect mapping file for persistence

2. **Automatic Redirect Generation**:
   ```typescript
   interface MigrationMap {
     [oldPath: string]: string // new path
     timestamp: string
     reason: string
   }
   ```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **SEO Optimization**:
   - Generate proper HTTP status codes (301 for permanent redirects)
   - Include canonical links pointing to new URLs
   - Add `rel="canonical"` meta tags
   - Preserve query parameters and hash fragments

2. **Analytics and Monitoring**:
   - Track redirect usage
   - Generate redirect reports
   - Identify broken redirects

## Specific Implementation for Zettelgarten → Writing Migration

### 1. Immediate Solution (Configuration-Based)

Add to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
Plugin.BulkRedirects({
  redirects: {
    // Pattern-based redirect for all zettelgarten content (excluding r/ subfolder)
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Experimental Zettelkasten Methodology": "writing/Notes on Experimental Zettelkasten Methodology",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Experimental Zettelkasten Methodology, Part 2": "writing/Notes on Experimental Zettelkasten Methodology, Part 2",
    "zettelgarten/Considerations on Delegate Agents": "writing/Considerations on Delegate Agents",
    "zettelgarten/Intimations of a Post-Machiavellian Moral-Tactical Calculus, Part 2": "writing/Intimations of a Post-Machiavellian Moral-Tactical Calculus, Part 2",
    "zettelgarten/Progress on the Development of Runique": "writing/Progress on the Development of Runique",
    "zettelgarten/Reflections on Applied Auto-Didactic Methodology": "writing/Reflections on Applied Auto-Didactic Methodology",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on an Ethical Hermeneutics of Machiavelli": "writing/Notes on an Ethical Hermeneutics of Machiavelli",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on the Distinction between Theoretical and Applied Governance": "writing/Notes on the Distinction between Theoretical and Applied Governance",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Methodology for Communities of Practice": "writing/Notes on Methodology for Communities of Practice",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Extitutional Theory and Progressive Protocolization": "writing/Notes on Extitutional Theory and Progressive Protocolization",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Keynes, Hayek, and Fiscal Protocols": "writing/Notes on Keynes, Hayek, and Fiscal Protocols",
    "zettelgarten/Intimations of a Post-Machiavellian Moral-Tactical Calculus": "writing/Intimations of a Post-Machiavellian Moral-Tactical Calculus",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Active Discursive Efforts": "writing/Notes on Active Discursive Efforts",
    "zettelgarten/Notes on Communicative Methodology": "writing/Notes on Communicative Methodology",
    "zettelgarten/Reflections on Deep-Network Diplomacy and Micropolitical Stabilization": "writing/Reflections on Deep-Network Diplomacy and Micropolitical Stabilization"
  },
  redirectType: 301, // Permanent redirect for SEO
  preserveQueryParams: true,
  preserveHash: true,
  generateCanonicalLinks: true
})
```

### 2. Pattern-Based Solution (More Scalable)

```typescript
Plugin.BulkRedirects({
  redirects: {
    // Use glob pattern for all zettelgarten files (excluding r/ subfolder)
    "zettelgarten/*": {
      destination: "writing/*",
      type: 301,
      preserveQuery: true,
      preserveHash: true
    }
  },
  excludePatterns: ["zettelgarten/r/*"] // Exclude r/ subfolder
})
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Redirect Page Generation

Each redirect will generate an HTML page with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
  <title>Redirecting...</title>
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.clinamenic.com/writing/[new-title]">
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://www.clinamenic.com/writing/[new-title]">
  <script>
    // JavaScript redirect as fallback
    window.location.replace("https://www.clinamenic.com/writing/[new-title]");
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Redirecting to <a href="https://www.clinamenic.com/writing/[new-title]">new location</a>...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. HTTP Status Code Handling

For proper SEO, the redirect pages should return HTTP 301 status codes. This requires:

1. **Server Configuration**: Configure your hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.) to serve these files with 301 status codes
2. **Meta Refresh Fallback**: Include meta refresh for clients that don't follow HTTP redirects
3. **JavaScript Fallback**: Include JavaScript redirect for maximum compatibility

### 3. Link Update Strategy

1. **Internal Link Updates**: The existing `CrawlLinks` transformer will automatically update internal links
2. **External Link Preservation**: Redirect pages will handle external links to old URLs
3. **Search Engine Indexing**: Canonical links ensure search engines understand the new URL structure

## Migration Workflow

### 1. Pre-Migration Steps

1. **Audit Current URLs**: Document all current zettelgarten URLs
2. **Plan New Structure**: Confirm the new writing/ folder structure
3. **Test Redirect Logic**: Implement and test redirect system with a few files first

### 2. Migration Execution

1. **Move Files**: Move files from `content/zettelgarten/` to `content/writing/`
2. **Update Configuration**: Add redirect rules to `quartz.config.ts`
3. **Build and Test**: Build the site and verify redirects work correctly
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the updated site with redirects in place

### 3. Post-Migration Monitoring

1. **Monitor Analytics**: Track traffic to old URLs
2. **Check Search Console**: Monitor for crawl errors
3. **Update External Links**: Gradually update any external links you control

## SEO Considerations

### 1. Link Equity Preservation

- Use 301 redirects to preserve link equity
- Include canonical links pointing to new URLs
- Maintain redirects for at least 6-12 months

### 2. Search Engine Communication

- Update sitemap.xml to reflect new URLs
- Submit new sitemap to search engines
- Monitor for crawl errors in Search Console

### 3. User Experience

- Provide clear redirect messages
- Include fallback links for users with JavaScript disabled
- Ensure redirects are fast and reliable
